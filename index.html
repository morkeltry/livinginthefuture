    Chances are you'll disagree with some of my predicitions and analyses.
    But the point of this page is not to convince you (though, hey, if you share my outlook, that's great!).
    What I'm really hoping to explain is why I want to turn my life to coding and developing technologies.

<div class="sky-colour-text main-text ">

  <p class="main-text" style="width:75%">
    Are you sitting comfortably? <br>
    Then I'll begin....
  </p><br>

  <p>The structure of society, in terms of the state, the economy, employment and
  democracy, is changing fundamentally.</p>

  <p>Changes in society, economy and technology are not just pushing change in the
  way we live, work and interact, they are also, particularly technology, <i>enabling</i>
  change. Founders and Coders is a great example of the kind of innovation in
  society which has been enabled, rather than merely pushed, by change.</p>

  <p>To say the information revolution is <a href="#">comparable</a> to the industrial revolution
  is not an overstatement. And further, in terms of technological literacy and
  adoption, we are approaching a tipping point, so that the <a title="(let's say 2010-2025)" href="#">period</a>
  we are now in, is crucial in deciding the direction these changes will
  move in for decades to come.</p>

<table class="main-text">
<tr><td class="sky-colour-text main-text">
  <p class="main-text">Much of this future social, cultural terrain is already being mapped out by
  giants. To take one example- any open AI will have an uphill task in the future
  to compete with Google. Or, to take another- the dominant model of low- and
  semi-skilled employment since the boom of the 1960s will find it difficult, even
  supported by the state, to hold its ground against the Uber-ised gig
  economy.</p>

  <p>But there are other areas of our lives where the future remains terra
  incognito. Facebook, for example, will one day go the way of MySpace, to be
  replaced by something even smarter. But by what? I hope it will be something
  more decentralised, modular and more responsive to its users' needs rather than
  the needs of monetisable innovations from the centre. But whether it is will
  depend on who chooses to build it. But perhaps a better example is in the realm
  of democracy. There, there has been no profit motive to
  drive new technology and so the field is wide open, to be designed as we
  choose!</p>
  <p>Almost anyone who has been involved in collective decision making, whether in
  a hierarchy such as most workplaces, whether in a democracy as small as a
  ten-person housing co-op or whether engaging with one as large as their national
  government, will have found it a slow and often frustrating process. In fact,
  the more truly and transparently power in an organisation is decentralised, the
  more unproductive labour it requires to engage in its processes. And that turns
  people off.</p>

<p>Almost anyone who has been involved in collective decision making, whether in
a hierarchy such as most workplaces, whether in a democracy as small as a
ten-person housing co-op or whether engaging with one as large as their national
government, will have found it a slow and often frustrating process. In fact,
the more truly and transparently power in an organisation is decentralised, the
more unproductive labour it requires to engage in its processes. And that turns
people off.</p>

<p>Democracy is dying a slow death. Liberal-democratic states are experiencing a
<a title="crisis of legitimation: a state retains its legal authority but loses moral authority over social norms, so that citizens' compliance requires enforcement instead" href="//www.controlrisks.com/en/our-thinking/analysis/the-crisis-of-legitimacy">crisis of legitimation</a>,
which will become something very unpleasant unless
there's some technological game-changer. Trump used his data analytic
<a title="" href="//www.theregister.co.uk/2017/03/07/cambridge_analytica_dystopianism/">game-changer</a>
to go from being a joke to being a president and this will very soon be a
trend. I would hope that the trend can be neutralised- through technology
enabling <a href="//voteflux.org/about/how/">direct democracy</a>, at a
<a href="//dil.berkeley.edu/technology-portfolio/current-projects/cafe/">fine-granular</a>
level, to counter different kinds of
<a href="//www.transparency.org/news/pressrelease/europes_unregulated_lobbying_opens_door_to_corruption">state capture</a>
(of which Trump is just one
<a href="//www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/01/trumps-appointees-conflicts-of-interest-a-crib-sheet/512711/">obvious example</a>).</p>

<p>On the smaller scale, technology can reduce by orders of magnitude the time
individuals need to spend on the democracy of small groups. Currently, if you
are a busy person, then the time overhead required to be meaningfully involved
in the democratic processes of a group normally means that you won't be able to
take part in them. That's something technology can change. </p>
<table>
<tr><td class="sky-colour-text main-text">
  <p>An example that intrigues me is peer-to-peer. P2P is ripe to be a revolution
  in the way we interact with technology in the next ten years. In developed
  countries, the cost of keeping a given device connected to the internet has
  fallen to almost zero and most people carry around a machine capable of secure
  encryption and multithreading in their pockets. But the tech economy hasn't
  adapted to it yet. Ten years from now, cryptocurrencies, smart city technology,
  and meshing IoT devices will have taken society unawares, just as email did.
  Compared to its full potential, P2P is still in its infancy. And someone will
  <a href="//shift.newco.co/bringing-up-machine-baby-bcaeb2bf6367">raise</a> the infant.
  Will that be Google, will it be a handful of start-up geniuses building the
  <a href="//fortune.com/unicorns/">unicorns</a> of the 2020s, or will it be a bunch of
  open-sourcers motivated by shaping the future for the next generation?</p>

  <p>It's not only designing and building the technologies of the future that will
  give today's coders (and indeed founders) the chance to make their mark on the
  world. But only people literate in systems, and particularly: coding;
  <a href="//edwardsnowden.com/revelations/">flows of data;</a>
  <a href="//harvardmagazine.com/2000/01/code-is-law-html">'code as law'</a>,
  will have a meaningful influence on the changes of the
  21st century. In the coming era, there will be new <a href="//google.com">monopolies</a> formed but, on the
  other hand, also a considerable overgrowing of the world's existing established
  <a href="//www.goldmansachs.com">repositories of power</a> by new
  <a title="production and innovation will no longer be something we do for economic reasons" href="//london.hackspace.org.uk/">social</a>,
  <a title="the economy we do create could be an economy of something other than money" href="//www.foundersandcoders.com/">economic</a> and
  <a title="institutions reliant on their own secret data will find it harder to survive" href="//wikileaks.org">technological</a> forms of human
  organisation. The shape, and the ethics, of these new forms will be determined
  by those in the current generation who are capable of intimately understanding
  the systems which will go about changing all of our world- that is, those of us
  who think as coders. And these new forms, and their ethics, will echo through
  culture and social organisation for many decades to come.</p>

<p>Most of you reading this page will find something in it that you disagree
with, or think is no more than wild speculative assertion. And wouldn't it be a
boring world if we all thought the same? But I hope you can see why I think that
coding is more than just a niche or skill equivalent to law or politics,  why I
think coders today are important for the whole of society tomorrow, why I hope
new forms like Founders and Coders, engaging a diverse bunch of people, are just
the tip of the iceberg and why, in the end, this is what I hope to be able to do
with my life…</p>
